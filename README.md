## Getting Started

This section provides an overview of RabbitMQ and how to get started with this repository's resources.

### What is RabbitMQ?

[RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) is a widely-used open-source message broker that facilitates communication between different parts of an application or between different applications. It implements the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) and offers features like message persistence, publish-subscribe messaging, message routing, and more.

### Prerequisites

Before using the resources in this repository, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- **RabbitMQ Server**: You'll need a RabbitMQ server running. You can install it locally or use a cloud-based RabbitMQ service.

- **Programming Language**: Depending on your use case, you might need a programming language such as Python, Node.js, or Java to interact with RabbitMQ.

- **Basic Understanding**: A basic understanding of message queuing and RabbitMQ concepts will be helpful.

## Installation

### Installing RabbitMQ Without Docker

1. **Install Erlang/OTP**: RabbitMQ requires the Erlang runtime to be installed. You can download it from the official website: [Erlang/OTP Downloads](https://www.erlang.org/downloads).

2. **Install RabbitMQ Server**:

   - On Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get update
     sudo apt-get install rabbitmq-server
     ```

   - On macOS (using Homebrew):
     ```bash
     brew install rabbitmq
     ```

   - On Windows:
     You can download the RabbitMQ installer from the official website: [RabbitMQ Downloads](https://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html).

3. **Start RabbitMQ Server**:

   - On Linux and macOS:
     ```bash
     sudo service rabbitmq-server start
     ```

   - On Windows:
     RabbitMQ should start automatically after installation. You can also start and stop it using the RabbitMQ Service management tool in the Windows Start menu.

4. **Verify RabbitMQ Installation**:

   To verify that RabbitMQ is installed and running, open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

   ```bash
   rabbitmqctl status
   ```

   This command should display information about the RabbitMQ server if it's running correctly.

### Installing RabbitMQ with Docker (Including GUI)

1. **Install Docker**: If you haven't already, install Docker by following the instructions for your operating system: [Docker Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

2. **Run RabbitMQ Container with GUI**:

   To run RabbitMQ with the Management GUI in a Docker container, you can use the official RabbitMQ Docker image that includes the GUI. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

   ```bash
   docker run -d --name rabbitmq -p 5672:5672 -p 15672:15672 rabbitmq:management
   ```

   - `-d`: Run the container in detached mode.
   - `--name rabbitmq`: Assign a name to the container.
   - `-p 5672:5672`: Map the RabbitMQ port.
   - `-p 15672:15672`: Map the RabbitMQ Management GUI port.

3. **Access the RabbitMQ Management Console**:

   - Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:15672/`.
   - Log in with the default username and password: "guest" (You can change these credentials in the RabbitMQ configuration if needed).

You now have RabbitMQ running in a Docker container, and the RabbitMQ Management GUI is accessible for monitoring and administration.
